/** The `MSManualScannerSession` class allows you to easily setup a scanning session
 * with tap-to-scan capability. This means the end-user typically triggers a scan via
 * a *manual* tap interaction and lets the session:
 *
 * - capture the next camera frame,
 * - perform a server-side search if no image result can be found on-device,
 * - report whether a match is found or not.
 *
 * This is simply achieved by calling snap when a tap occurs.
 *
 * Since this class conveniently handles server-side search it is the perfect candidate
 * when you have a large collection of reference images that exceeds the on-device database
 * capacity.
 *
 * Think of it as a convenient and configurable wrapper around a MSScanner object
 * that hides the messy details of setting up an AVFoundation video capture and
 * scanning incoming frames.
 *
 * To make it easy to display the live video capture on-screen, the scanner session
 * includes a captureLayer that you can directly insert into your view.
 *
 * If you plan to support multiple orientations on the UI side you are responsible to:
 *
 * - tell the session which orientation currently takes effect via the interfaceOrientation
 * property,
 * - update the captureLayer bounds to reflect the current UI,
 * - set the right video orientation via the `AVCaptureVideoPreviewLayer` `connection`
 * property.
